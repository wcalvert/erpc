/*  SIMPLE BINARY PROTOCOL DESCRIPTION
    ==================================

    This simple messaging protocol can be used to send and receive binary
    messages using any binary serial bus (USB HID, USB Bulk, SPI, I2C,
    Wireless, etc.).

    The protocol is designed to be flexible and extensible, with the only
    requirement being that individual messages are 64 bytes or smaller,
    and that the first byte of every message is a one byte (U8) identifier
    that indicates the format for the rest of the payload (if there is one).

    IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
    ====================

    The protocol implementation must be transport mechanism agnostic, and
    should be able to function with any binary serial bus. The original
    design goal is a protocol that can function via USB HID, SPI Slave,
    and I2C Slave modes, but any similar protocol should be able to be
    added to the implementation (wireless transfers, etc.).

    ENDIANNESS
    ==========

    All values larger than 8-bits are expected to be little endian, such
    as the command IDs, and the payload contents.  Any deviation from
    this rule should be clearly documented.

    MESSAGE TYPES
    =============

    Each message is preceded by an 8-bit message identifier that indicates
    the format and content of the rest of the message:

    |-----------------------+---------+--------------------------------------|
    | Message Type          | ID (U8) | Meaning                              |
    |-----------------------+---------+--------------------------------------|
    | Command               | 0x10    |                                      |
    | Response              | 0x20    |                                      |
    | Alert                 | 0x40    |                                      |
    | Error                 | 0x80    |                                      |
    |-----------------------+---------+--------------------------------------|

    COMMAND MESSAGES
    ================

    Command messages (Message Type = 0x10) have the following structure:

    |-------------------+----------+-----------------------------------------|
    | Name              | Type     | Meaning                                 |
    |-------------------+----------+-----------------------------------------|
    | Message Type      | U8       | Always '0x10'                           |
    | Command ID        | U16      | Unique command identifier               |
    | Payload Length    | U8       | Payload length (0..60)                  |
    | Payload           | ...      | Optional command payload (params, etc.) |
    |-------------------+----------+-----------------------------------------|

    'Command ID' (bytes 1-2) and 'Payload Length' (byte 3) are mandatory in
    any command message.  The message payload is optional, and will be ignored
    if Payload Length is set to '0' bytes.  When a message payload is present,
    it's length can be anywhere from 1..60 bytes, to stay within the 64 byte
    maximum message length.

    The contents of the payload is user defined, and can change for each
    command. Any payload error checking should be done by the individual
    command handler.

    A sample command message would be:

    Byte   0    1  2    3    4
          [10] [34 12] [01] [FF]

    - The first byte is the Message Type (0x10), which identifies this as a
      command message.
    - The second and third bytes are 0x1234 (34 12 in little-endian notation),
      which is the unique command ID that will be parsed to the command lookup
      function, and redirected to an appropriate command handler function.
    - The fourth byte indicates that we have a message payload of 1 byte
    - The fifth bytes is the 1 byte payload: 0xFF

    RESPONSE MESSAGES
    =================

    Responses messages (Message Type = 0x20) are generated in response to an
    incoming command, and have the following structure:

    |-------------------+----------+-----------------------------------------|
    | Name              | Type     | Meaning                                 |
    |-------------------+----------+-----------------------------------------|
    | Message Type      | U8       | Always '0x20'                           |
    | Command ID        | U16      | Command ID of the command this message  |
    |                   |          | is a response to, to correlate          |
    |                   |          | Responses and commands                  |
    | Payload Length    | U8       | Payload length (0..60)                  |
    | Payload           | ...      | Optional response payload               |
    |-------------------+----------+-----------------------------------------|

    By including the 'Command ID' that this response message is related to,
    the recipient can more easily correlate responses and commands.  This is
    useful in situations where multiple commands are sent, and some commands
    may take a longer period of time to execute than subsequent commands with
    a different command ID.

    Response message can only be generates in response to a command message,
    so the Command ID should always be present.

    If more precise command/response correlation is required, a custom
    protocol can be developped, where a unique message identifier is included
    in the payload of each command/response, but this is beyond the scope of
    this high-level protocol.

    A sample response message would be:

    Byte   0    1  2    3    4
          [20] [34 12] [01] [FF]

    - The first byte is the Message Type (0x20), which identifies this as a
      response message.
    - The second and third bytes are 0x1234, which is the unique command ID
      that this response is related to.
    - The fourth byte indicates that we have a message payload of 1 byte
    - The fifth byte is the 1 byte payload: 0xFF

    ALERT MESSAGES
    ==============

    Alert messages (Message Type = 0x40) are sent whenever an alert condition
    is present on the system (low battery, etc.), and have the following
    structure:

    |-------------------+----------+-----------------------------------------|
    | Name              | Type     | Meaning                                 |
    |-------------------+----------+-----------------------------------------|
    | Message Type      | U8       | Always '0x40'                           |
    | Alert ID          | U16      | Unique ID for the alert condition       |
    | Payload Length    | U8       | Payload length (0..60)                  |
    | Payload           | ...      | Optional response payload               |
    |-------------------+----------+-----------------------------------------|

    A sample alert message would be:

    Byte   0    1  2    3    4    5    6    7
          [40] [34 12] [04] [42] [07] [00] [10]

    - The first byte is the Message Type (0x40), which identifies this as an
      alert message.
    - The second and third bytes are 0x1234, which is the unique alert ID.
    - The fourth byte indicates that we have a message payload of 4 byte
    - The last four bytes are the actual payload: '0x10000742' in this case,
      assuming we were transmitting a 32-bit value in little-endian format.

    ERROR MESSAGES
    ==============

    Error messages (Message Type = 0x80) are returned whenever an error
    condition is present on the system, and have the following structure:

    |-------------------+----------+-----------------------------------------|
    | Name              | Type     | Meaning                                 |
    |-------------------+----------+-----------------------------------------|
    | Message Type      | U8       | Always '0x80'                           |
    | Error ID          | U16      | Unique ID for the error condition       |
    |-------------------+----------+-----------------------------------------|

    Whenever an error condition is present and the system needs to be alerted
    (such as a failed request, an attempt to access a non-existing resource,
    etc.) the system can return a specific error message with an appropriate
    Error ID.

    A sample error message would be:

    Byte   0    1  2
          [80] [00 01]

    - The first byte is the Message Type (0x80), which identifies this is an
      error message.
    - The second and third bytes are 0x0100 (00 01 in little-endian notation),
      which is the error code corresponding to PROT_ERROR_INVALID_PARAM.
